# 🔁 Reuse Capability Catalog

This project defines a structured catalog of reusable capabilities available across our firm, helping developers identify and adopt existing architecture patterns, libraries, and platforms instead of reinventing the wheel.

## 🧭 Purpose

The catalog allows teams to:

- Explore existing technology assets based on the **functionality** and **capabilities** they offer
- Compare tools across standardized capability layers
- Encourage reuse by improving discoverability and consistency

## 🧱 Capability Layers

The project is organized around five key layers:

1. **Business** – e.g. Customer Management, Financial Management
2. **Application** – e.g. Workflow Orchestration, Business Rules Engines
3. **Data** – e.g. Master Data, Analytics, OLTP
4. **Infrastructure** – e.g. CI/CD, Hosting, Compute, Caching
5. **Security** – e.g. IAM, Data Protection, Vulnerability Management

Each capability includes examples, definitions, benefits, and related technologies.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

This is a SvelteKit application hosted on Cloudflare Workers and built with:

- 🧩 **TailwindCSS** – for styling
- 🧪 **Vitest** – for testing
- 🧱 **shadcn-svelte** – for UI components

## 📁 Structure

- `lib/data/` – all capability definitions and metadata
- `lib/components/` – reusable UI blocks
- `routes/` – SvelteKit routes for browsing the catalog
- `docs/` – documentation for maintainers and AI assistants

## 🚀 Goal

To provide a single reference point for teams to **assess**, **compare**, and **adopt** reusable capabilities across our technology landscape.
