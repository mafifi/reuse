Implementing this pattern requires stateful processing to track and store incoming messages until all required parts are received. Correlation logic is essential to determine which messages belong together, often using unique identifiers or keys. A completeness condition defines when enough data has arrived to trigger aggregation—this could be based on a count, a timeout, or the presence of specific elements. Finally, an aggregation algorithm combines the collected messages into a unified result, which is then emitted downstream. This pattern is critical for scenarios such as order fulfillment, batch processing, or any workflow where data from multiple events must be merged before further processing.",
